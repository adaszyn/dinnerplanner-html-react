This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### How to get started

1. First, make sure that you have npm installed on your system (follow the instructions
   at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). If you're on
   macOS, npm should also be available through Homebrew if you're already using
   that for package management.

2. Run `npm install` through the terminal in the root of the repository. Let it
   install all the dependencies.

3. Run `npm start` through the terminal. The application should pop up in your
   browser ready for use. Whenever you make changes in your code and save, the browser
   will update automatically.
